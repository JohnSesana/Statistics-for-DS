    "- **Null Hypothesis ($H₀$)**: This is the starting assumption that there is no effect or no difference between groups or things you're testing. It's like saying, \"Nothing is happening here\".\n",
    "- **Althernative Hypothesis($H₁$)**: This challenges the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is an efect or difference. It's like saying, \"Something is happening here\".\n",
    "- **p-value**: This is a number that tell syou how likely it is to see your data(or something even more unusual) if the null hyothesis were true. A small p-value means your data is strange enought that it makes you doubt the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Significance Level ($α$)**: This is a cut-off point you choose beforehand (like 0.05 or 0.01). It helps you decide whether the p-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than $a$, you can say, \"It's unlikely the null hypothesis is true, so I'll reject it\" "
